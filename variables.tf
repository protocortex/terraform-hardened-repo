    Capability gate for the eight settings GitHub's free tier rejects with a 403
    on private repos: rulesets (protect_default_branch, protect_tag_pattern),
    vulnerability alerts, secret scanning (+ push protection), Dependabot
    security updates, dependency-review workflow, and private vulnerability
    reporting.

    Leave null (the default) to derive it from visibility, which is the correct
    behaviour for almost every caller: private means the features are
    unavailable and are forced off, public means they are free and apply. The
    gate re-evaluates on every plan, so flipping a repo public applies them and
    flipping it back private reverts them, with no second flag to keep in sync.

    Set it explicitly only to override that derivation: false on a private repo
    that really is on GitHub Pro/Team/GHAS (the features are available, so let
    them apply), or true to force everything off regardless of visibility.

    Individual feature vars still override downward, but cannot turn a feature

# Two-tier design: orgs (igorjs-iac, igorjs-forks) get the same secrets
# at org scope via org-secrets.tf, set once per org, available to all
# repos in the org via `secrets.BOT_APP_*` references. User-account
# repos (pure-*, ward, liam under igorjs) cannot use org secrets
# (GitHub's secret model has no user-level Actions secrets), so they
# opt in to per-repo TF-managed secrets via this variable. The values
# come from the same HCP workspace variables in both cases, so there's
# one source of truth.
#
# Default false because most repos have no App-token workflow today
# (they use secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN). Flip to true on the repo that
# actually needs it; the next apply pushes both secrets to the repo.

# implemented; "rust" and "golang" will be added in follow-up PRs as
# those repos (ward, libkrun-builds) lift their hand-tuned workflows
# into the module. Until then, set manage_workflow_* = false on those
# repos and they keep their bespoke files.
#
# Why three separate manage_workflow_* toggles instead of one global
# flag: each repo may want a custom CI matrix while still benefiting
# from the shared SLSA L3 release/publish pipeline (or vice versa).
# Independent toggles let those decisions diverge per-repo.
